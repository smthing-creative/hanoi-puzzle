# hanoi-puzzle

The Tower of Hanoi or the Hanoi puzzle is is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:[4]

    Only one disk may be moved at a time.
    Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
    No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks. 


In this project, I have two solutions for the puzzle: first an iterative solution using a loop-based approach. The second is a recursive solution.

Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.
